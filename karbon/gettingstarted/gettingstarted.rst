<STILL NEED TO PROVIDE OVERALL INTRO>

..
   You will learn the basic steps to migrate (?) an existing 2-tier application to a containerized application.

   During this workshop, you will learn how to:

      - Build and test the new containers [ARE WE BUILDING, IF THESE ARE DEPLOYED FROM CALM?]

      - Upload the containers to Docker hub registry [WHY?]

      - Deploy the new containers [SOMETHING MORE DESCRIPTIVE?]

Your Environment
++++++++++++++++

To let you experience the most fun and interesting parts of the lab, as well as accommodate the large number of simultaneous users, multiple components have already been staged for you. *Let's explore!*

Tools VM
........

The Windows Tools VM provides a number of different applications used across multiple Nutanix Bootcamps. Filter for your **USER**\ *##* in **Prism Central > Virtual Infrastructure > VMs** and take note of the IP of your **USER**\ *##*\ **WinToolsVM** VM, as you will be connecting to this VM via RDP (using **NTNXLAB** Administrator credentials).

In the following labs you will use the Tools VM to access the **Visual Studio Code** text editor, which has been pre-installed with a number of extensions for working with Git and containers.
