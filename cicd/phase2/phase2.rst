------------------------------
Build the CI/CD Infrastructure
------------------------------

While creating the containerized version of Fiesta, we used a text editor (ex. `vi` or `nano`) to manipulate files. While these tools can certain do the job, as we've seen, this method is not exactly easy, or efficient to modify files on a large scale. Instead, we are going to use *Visual Studio Code*. Once we have *Visual Studio Code* installed and configured, we will setup our CI/CD pipeline using *Drone*.

*Visual Studio Code* is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

*Drone* by Harness is a modern Continuous Integration (CI) platform that empowers busy teams to automate their build, test and release workflows using a powerful, cloud native pipeline engine.

.. note::

   Estimated time **30 minutes**.

We need to build the CI/CD pipeline. For this we are going to setup the following parts:

   - Visual Studio Code (VSC) - controls the commit and push of the new code
   - Gitea - version control manager
   - Drone - CI/CD part of the pipeline

Visual Studio Code (VSC)
........................

#. Remote Desktop into your *UserXX*\ **-WinToolsVM**.

#. Open Visual Studio Code, and click on **View > Command Palette...**.

   .. figure:: images/1.png

#. Type **Remote SSH**, and select **Remote-SSH: Connect Current Window to Host...**.

   .. figure:: images/2.png

#. Click on **+ Add New SSH Host...** and type **ssh root@<DOCKER-VM-IP-ADDRESS>** and hit **Enter**.

   [screenshot]

#. Select the location **C:\\Users\\Administrator.<MACHINE-NAME>\\.ssh\\config** (typically first entry) to update the config file.

#. Select **Connect** on the pop-up in the bottom right corner to connect to the VM.

#. Input the following in succession, and hit **Enter**.

   - O/S - Linux
   - Fingerprint - Continue
   - Password - nutanix/4u

#. Click on both messages that may pop-up in the bottom right hand corner, the **Don't Show Again** button.

[Any reason we don't just want to have the version it's looking for - in this case Git > v2.0?]

   .. figure:: images/3.png

#. Click the **Files** button from the left-hand pane, and then select **Open Folder**.

   .. figure:: images/4.png

#. Provide the ``/`` as the folder you want to open and click on **OK**

#. It will take some time before it opens as VC needs to install and configure the remote host. This takes approximately <1 minute (you might be asked for the password again)
#. Now you should see the folder structure of the VM, open **/root/github** and you will see everything created earlier

   .. figure:: images/5.png

[This process is wonky for me. We have to give explicit instructions on how to get / to work. I had to type /. and then remove the period, so it didn't auto-select the bin directory.]

[Also got warning/error every time I did this: Unable to watch for file changes in this large workspace folder. Please follow the instructions link to resolve this issue. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_visual-studio-code-is-unable-to-watch-for-file-changes-in-this-large-workspace-error-enospc ]

   It will take approximately 1 minute (you might be asked for the password again) [Confirm if they will or not].

#. Now you should see [will they?] the folder structure of the VM. Expand **root > github** to see the files we created earlier.

   .. figure:: images/5.png

This method of modifying files is easier than ``vi`` or ``nano``. [Are we just showing them a graphical viewer, that has no other benefits? Check back on this to ensure VSC has other value!]

Preparation [?]
...........

As we already have created the needed infrastructure using `docker-compose`, we're going to pull the existing yaml file, make changes and start the CI/CD pipeline.

#. Open a ssh session to your *Initials*\ **-dockervm** by using VSC's built in terminal.

#. Within VSC, click on **Terminal ->  New Terminal**. This will open a new ssh session to the machine you had already opened to see the "remote folder" and saves switching between windows

   .. figure:: images/6.png

   .. figure:: images/7.png

[We should also tell them to close the Welcome message, and hit up/down arrow for the terminal window to adjust it, vs. working in this little space at the bottom]

#. In the terminal run the following commands to get the needed directories

   .. code-block:: bash

       mkdir -p ~/github
       mkdir -p /docker-location/gitea
       mkdir -p /docker-location/drone/server
       mkdir -p /docker-location/drone/agent
       mkdir -p /docker-location/mysql

#. In the Terminal of VC, run ``cd ~/github``
#. Run the command ``curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nutanixworkshops/gts21/master/cicd/docker_files/docker-compose.yaml -O`` to pull the yaml file

#. Run ``docker login`` to make sure you are logged in. This command will use the earlier used credentials to log you in.

#. In the terminal screen run the command ``docker-compose create db gitea`` and wait for the command prompt to return. You will see that images are pulled and at the end that the two services have been created

   .. figure:: images/9.png

#. Run ``docker-compose start db gitea`` to start the MySQL and Gitea containers.

[Got a warning this command is deprecated: WARNING: The create command is deprecated. Use the up command with the --no-start flag instead.]

Now that we have part of our CI/CD running, we need to configure it. We start with Gitea and end with Drone.

Gitea configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make sure we can use https with Gitea, we need to go into the gitea docker container. Run a command and define what we need. Then we can configure Gitea to use the Self Signed SSL certificates.

#. Run ``docker exec -it gitea /bin/bash``
#. In the docker prompt run ``gitea cert --host <IP ADDRESS OF THE DOCKER VM>``. This will create two files **cert.pem** and **key.pem** in the root of the container.

   .. figure:: images/10.png

#. Copy the \*.pem files using ``cp /*.pem /data/gitea``
#. Run ``chmod 744 /data/gitea/*.pem``
#. Close the docker connection using **<CTRL>+d**
#. Open a browser and point it to **http://<IP ADDRESS DOCKER VM>:3000**
#. Make the following changes:

   - MySQL section:

     - **Host**: <IP ADDRESS OF YOUR DOCKER VM>:3306
     - **Password**: gitea

   .. figure:: images/10-1.png

   - General Settings:

     - **SSH Server Port**: 2222
     - **Gitea Base URL**: ``https://<IP ADDRESS OF YOUR DOCKER VM>:3000``

   .. figure:: images/11.png

#. Click the **Install Gitea** button

[I'm concerned that if folks do something wrong at this step, they are hosed.]

Now you will receive an error that **This site canâ€™t provide a secure connection**, but we are going to change that.
In VSC, as we have all files for the containers being saved on the docker VM in the earlier created folders in /docker-location, we can change a file that is needed by Gitea and holds the config.

[I did not get this error]

#. Open your VC
#. Open the file **/docker-location/gitea/conf/app.ini** and add the following lines under the **[server]** section:

[We should say they need to add this to the top, vs. make these changes. Maybe we have a copy/paste with the proper formatting?]

   - **PROTOCOL**  = https
   - **CERT_FILE** = cert.pem
   - **KEY_FILE**  = key.pem

     .. figure:: images/12.png

#. Save the file and restart the container using ``docker-compose restart gitea`` in your terminal windows in VC
#. Reloading the browser page (\https://<IP ADDRESS OF YOUR DOCKER VM>:3000) will show an error on the certificate, which is logical as we are now using a Self Signed certificate. Use the normal ways to get to the login screen.
#. The first user will be the admin user of the Gitea application (default)
#. Click the **Register button** to create an account. Provide whatever you want. We are going to use **nutanix**, **nutanix@atnutanix.com** and **nutanix/4u** during the workshop as examples.
#. Click the Register button to have your account created.

   .. figure:: images/14.png

Welcome to Gitea!!!

------

Drone Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As Drone will use Gitea for its authentication, we need to get some parameters from Gitea and change the docker-compose.yaml file.

#. In your gitea click **Settings** by clicking on the Avatar in the right hand top corner

   .. figure:: images/15.png

#. Select Applications and fill the following parameters (under the **Manage OAuth2 Applications** section):

   - **Application name:** drone
   - **Redirect URI:** ``http://<DOCKER-VM-IP-ADDRESS>:8080/login``

[YOU SAY TO SAVE LATER IN THE INSTRUCTIONS. MIGHT WANT TO MENTION *NOT* TO SAVE IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO HERE.]

#. Click the **Create Application** button
#. Copy from the next screen the Client ID and the Client Secret to Notepad or similar, as you will need this in the proceeding steps.

   .. figure:: images/16.png

#. Open the **docker-compose.yaml** file [WHERE? WHAT SECTION?] in VSC and paste the values in their field names **DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_ID** and **DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET** [THEY MIGHT HAVE TO REFRESH VSC (I DID), SO ADD INSTRUCTIONS FOR THAT]

#. Also change under the **drone-server** section in the docker-compose.yaml file

   - **DRONE_GITEA_SERVER=** \https://<IP ADDRESS OF DOCKER VM>:3000
   - **DRONE_SERVER_HOST=** <IP ADDRESS OF DOCKER VM>:8080
   - **DRONE_USER_CREATE=** <USERNAME> to **nutanix** [THIS WAS ALREADY NUTANIX FOR ME, BUT I DIDN'T USE THAT. RECOMMEND CHANGING TO <GITEA-USERNAME> OR SIMILAR.]

   .. figure:: images/17.png


   .. note::

[UPDATE SCREEN SHOT AS LINE #'S DON'T MATCH WHAT IS IN FILE]

#. Change under the [START THE]**drone-docker-runner** section

   - **DRONE_RPC_HOST=** <IP ADDRESS OF DOCKER VM>

   .. figure:: images/17-1.png

#. Save the file
#. Click in Gitea UI the **Save** button and then click **Dashboard** (top left).
#. Open [RETURN TO?] the Terminal in VSC. [CHANGE DIR TO ~/GITHUB IF THEY ARE OPENING NEW. DOESN'T HURT TO REMIND THEM.]

#. Create and start the drone server and agent container by running ``docker-compose create drone-server drone-docker-runner`` and ``docker-compose start drone-server drone-docker-runner``

[IF WE CAN RUN THESE CONSECUTIVELY WITHOUT ERROR, PUT THEM IN A BASH COPY/PASTE TEXT BOX TO MAKE THIS EASIER/FASTER. SEEMED TO WORK AOK FOR ME.]

[GOT A BOX OPENED IN LOWER RIGHT WARNING ME OF RUNNING ON PORT 8080]

#. Open a browser and point to ``http://<DOCKER-VM-IP-ADDRESS>:8080``. This will try to authenticate the user defined user in the Drone section of the docker-compose.yaml file.

#. A warning **Authorize Application** message is shown, click on **Authorize Application**

   .. figure:: images/19.png

#. The Drone UI will open with nothing in it

We have just created our first CI/CD pipeline infrasturcture. **But** we still have to do a few thing...

- The way of working using **vi** or **nano** is not very effective and ready for human error (:fa:`thumbs-up`) [How does this remove human error, since we are still copy/pasting and typing things?]

- Variables needed, have to be set outside of the image we build (:fa:`thumbs-down`)
- The container build takes a long time and is a tedious work including it's management (:fa:`thumbs-down`)
- The start of the container takes a long time (:fa:`thumbs-down`)
- The image is only available as long as the Docker VM exists (:fa:`thumbs-down`)

The next modules in this workshop are going to address these :fa:`thumbs-down`.... Let's go for it:fa:`thumbs-up`!
